##This project
In this project we created an environment to simulate the inverted pendulum to create and test classic control algorithms such as PID and Cascaded PID To archive some tasks such as: 1-keep the pendulum in equilibrium (PID) 2-Establish a constant speed keeping the pendulum in equilibrium (cascading PID) 3-Let the robot go to a point 1D (triple cascade PID). This simulator was created in order to build a real self balancing robot, the environment was developed using angular 7. Inside the folder of inv_pend (Angular 7) follow the instructions to execute the program
